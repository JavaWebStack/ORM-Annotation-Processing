# ORM-Annotation-Processing
This is an attempt on implementing lombok-like annotation processing to auto create relation methods and more  
  
This requires some internal javac classes, so it depends on tools.jar which is part of the jdk. You might need to change your JAVA_HOME to point to a proper jdk8 installation.
At the moment this is just a proof-of-concept so it's nowhere near usable, which is the main reason why we moved it to a seperate repository.
